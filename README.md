__This was a short Visualization of a Möbius Strip through the parametric equations via the__


__Universtiy of California at San Diego in their__

__"Math 31CH: Möbius strip" lecture.__

This Project was possible via the Processing Open Source Engine to further Simulate the
multi-variable parametric equation below on a 3-D Plane.

PeasyCam was also an add-on paired with this program to allow free camera movement
throughout the simulation.

As per the paper,


**_x = cos(θ)[2 + t cos(θ/2)]_**


**_y = sin(θ)[2 + t cos(θ/2)]_**


**_z = tsin(θ/2)_**


with the independent variables, **p(θ,t)**.
